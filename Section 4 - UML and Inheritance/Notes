Designing and changing systems always involve communication between you, your teammates, and the customer.

Architects use build plans to design houses, and electrical engineers use wiring schemes. Build plans and wiring schemes
are the design languages for architects and electrical engineers. Software engineers have their own design language,
called UML. UML stands for "Universal Modeling Language", and has symbols to represent software.
